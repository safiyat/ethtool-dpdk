# ethtool-dpdk

From the [Sample Application user guide](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides-17.08/sample_app_ug/ethtool.html):
> The Ethtool sample application shows an implementation of an ethtool-like API and provides a console environment that allows its use to query and change Ethernet card parameters. The sample is based upon a simple L2 frame reflector.

This project here is just with a few added bells and whistles that not everybody may want.
Based on dpdk release [v17.08](http://dpdk.org/browse/dpdk-stable/?h=17.08).
